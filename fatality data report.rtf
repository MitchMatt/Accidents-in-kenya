\b\fs24 1. Business Understanding\b0\par
\b Objective:\b0\par
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of fatality  occurring in accidents based on specific factors, such as location, time, and other contextual data.

Ultimately, the project seeks to support traffic safety authorities in reducing accidents through data-driven decision-making.\par
Key Questions:\par
\tab\f1\bullet\tab What are the main factors contributing to accidents?\par
\tab\bullet\tab Can we accurately predict accidents and identify high-risk areas or times?\par
\tab\bullet\tab How can the predictive model be deployed for real-time applications?\par
