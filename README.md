# Road Accidents Fatality Prediction
This repository contains an analysis and  prediction of fatality of crashes on Kenyan roads.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of fatal outcomes in road crashes using historical crash data. Insights from this model will help transportation agencies, public safety departments, and urban planners develop data-driven interventions to reduce fatalities.
#### Main Objective(s)
*	Analyze historical crash data from 2012-2023 to identify fatality patterns.
* Train a machine learning model to predict fatality likelihood in road crashes.
* Deploy a web-based interface for real-time fatality risk prediction.
##### Specific Objectives
* Identify key factors influencing fatality risks (e.g., location, time of day, weather conditions).
* Provide data-driven insights to support road safety campaigns and infrastructure planning.
### Business Understanding
Road traffic accidents are a significant public safety concern in Kenya, contributing to high fatality rates. Effective measures to reduce fatalities require identifying the factors that increase the likelihood of death in accidents.The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of fatal outcomes in road crashes using historical crash data. Insights from this model will help transportation agencies, public safety departments, and urban planners develop data-driven interventions to reduce fatalities.
### Data Understanding
The project will utilize crash data collected from Kenya’s road accidents between 2012-2023, sourced from the World Bank microdata platform. The dataset contains multiple features that describe road crashes and their outcomes.
Dataset Overview:
* Crash Date and Time: When the crash occurred (time of day, date).
* Location: Geographic details such as latitude, longitude, and road name.
* Crash Description Keywords: Keywords that describe the nature of the crash (e.g., “fatality,” “pedestrian,” “motorcycle”).
* Weather and Road Conditions: Environmental factors such as road wetness, fog, or traffic levels.
* Crash Outcome: Binary indicator (fatal or non-fatal).
